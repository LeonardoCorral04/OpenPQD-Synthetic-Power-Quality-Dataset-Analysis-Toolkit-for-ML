Researchers have the option to configure several parameters in the code. This dataset have these constants:
  * The number of samples of each class to be generated (Ns). By default, 200 samples per class.

  * The sampling frequency (Fs). The default value of this parameter is 10 kHz. 
  
  * The fundamental frequency (f). The default value is 60 Hz.
  
  * The number of cycles of the fundamental frequency to be included in each disturbance (N). 
    By default, each signal comprise 30 cycles (0.5 seconds).
  
  * The normal amplitude of the signals (A) in the range of Voltage. By default the function generates the
    amplitude of the PQ distortions of 1 per unit (p.u.).
